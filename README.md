# üß© SNESIM with Reverse Query Search Tree (C# Implementation)

A high-performance **SNESIM (Single Normal Equation Simulation)** algorithm implemented in C#,
featuring a **Reverse Query Search Tree (R-STree)** and **Reverse Auxiliary Retrieval Structure (RARS)**
for accelerating probability retrieval during the early stages of stochastic simulation.

---

## üöÄ Key Innovation ‚Äî Reverse Query Mechanism

Traditional SNESIM algorithms rely on **forward traversal** of the search tree (STree) to retrieve conditional probabilities.
However, at the **early stage of simulation**, when only a few conditioning data points exist around each prediction node,
forward queries require exploring a large number of possible combinations, resulting in **high traversal cost** and **low efficiency**.

To address this, the present implementation introduces a **Reverse Query Search Tree (R-STree)** with a corresponding
**Reverse Auxiliary Retrieval Structure (RARS)**. Together, they enable fast, parallelizable pattern retrieval.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Principle of Reverse Query

* **1. Early-stage optimization (‚âà first 30‚Äì35%)**
  When few conditioning nodes exist, the algorithm switches from forward to **reverse query** mode.

* **2. Reverse query process**

  * Identify the **farthest conditioning point** in the data event.
  * Use its value and relative position to directly access matching nodes in the RARS at the corresponding tree depth.
  * Verify whether these candidate nodes satisfy all remaining conditioning values.
  * If no full match is found, remove the farthest point and repeat until sufficient matches are collected.
  * Count the frequencies of central-node values and sample from the resulting conditional probability distribution.

* **3. Transition to forward query**
  As simulation progresses and local conditioning data become denser, the algorithm automatically switches
  back to the **standard forward query**, where early pruning becomes efficient.

## üßÆ Reverse Auxiliary Retrieval Structure (RARS)

The **RARS** is a level-wise dictionary structure built on top of the STree:

| Component   | Description                                                                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Key**     | Attribute value at a given tree level                                                 |
| **Value**   | Set of all tree nodes at that level sharing the same key                              |
| **Purpose** | Enables constant-time access to all candidate nodes for a specific conditioning value |

This structure avoids scanning the full STree and allows **parallel filtering** at each level,
making the reverse query inherently suitable for **multi-core execution**.

## ‚ö° Performance

| Simulation Strategy                       | Description                     | Typical Speed-up |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Forward Query Only                        | Standard SNESIM traversal       | Baseline         |
| Reverse Query Only                        | Reverse retrieval for all steps | 2√ó‚Äì5√ó            |
| **Hybrid (Reverse 30‚Äì35%, then Forward)** | Proposed method                 | **4√ó‚Äì10√ó**       |

Empirical results on 2D and 3D training images show that hybrid query achieves the best efficiency‚Äìstability balance,
with up to **9.5√ó acceleration** depending on spatial structure complexity.

### üöÄ Example Usage

Below is a **minimal working example** performing a 2D stochastic simulation
with **reverse query + multi-resolution pyramid acceleration**.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using JAM8.Algorithms.Geometry;
using JAM8.Utilities;

// Define training image grid size
int ti_nx = 101, ti_ny = 101, ti_nz = 1;
GridStructure ti_gs = GridStructure.create_simple(ti_nx, ti_ny, ti_nz);
var ti_grid = Grid.create(ti_gs);

// Locate training image file (relative to repo root)
string repoRoot = Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine(AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory, "..", "..", ".."));
string tiPath = Path.Combine(repoRoot, "training images", "channel.out");

// Read training image from GSLIB file
ti_grid.read_from_gslib(tiPath, 0, -99);
GridProperty ti = ti_grid.first_gridProperty();

// Define simulation grid (same size as TI)
GridStructure re_gs = GridStructure.create_simple(ti_nx, ti_ny, ti_nz);
GridProperty origin_re = GridProperty.create(re_gs);

// Simulation parameters
List<(int, double, double, double)> snesim_paras =
[
    (40, 1, 1, 1),
    (40, 1, 1, 1),
    (40, 1, 1, 1)
];

int random_seed = 123456;
int progress_for_retrieve_inverse = 0;

// Start simulation
var sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();
MyConsoleHelper.write_value_to_console("===== Start SNESIM with Reverse Query =====");

var re = Snesim.run_multi_resolution(
    origin_re.deep_clone(),
    ti,
    snesim_paras,
    progress_for_retrieve_inverse,
    random_seed
);

sw.Stop();
MyConsoleHelper.write_value_to_console($"[SNESIM Simulation] Elapsed time: {sw.Elapsed.TotalSeconds:F3} seconds");

// Save result
string outDir = Path.Combine(repoRoot, "out");
Directory.CreateDirectory(outDir);
string outPath = Path.Combine(outDir, "sim.out");
re.convert_to_grid().save_to_gslib(outPath, "default_name", -99);
```

**Output file:**
`out/sim.out` ‚Äî in GSLIB format, containing the simulated facies grid.

## üß© Integration Notes

Although the simulation supports a **multi-resolution pyramid**,
it serves mainly as a computational accelerator and has **no conceptual difference** from multi-grid SNESIM.
The **Reverse Query mechanism** remains the core innovation,
and it can operate independently or in combination with pyramid-based workflows.
